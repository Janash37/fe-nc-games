# 2D6 Game Reviews - NC games front-end

## Background

This front end was created as a companion piece to the back-end project "Jan's boardgame API", which provided data on a series of board games and game reviews. The process of building this app was intended as an introduction on how to produce a functional, tested and user-friendly front-end.

---

## Using the app

The app is fairly self-explanatory in terms of how to navigate around. Users can view game reviews posted by others, vote on the usefulness of those reviews and submit their own comments. A user profile section will be implemented in the near future.
